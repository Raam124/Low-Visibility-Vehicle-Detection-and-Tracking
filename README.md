Used latest version of openCV 4.2 and Visual Studio 2019. This application works in low visibility climates like snow or fog to detect and track the vehicles where a normal CCTV struggles 


This project is inspired by some youtube demo videos and some github projects. Soon I'll mention those here.

installation is simple just install OpenCV latest version this project uses 4.2 and Visual Studio 2019.

Just create main.cpp,blob.cpp,blob.io and copy those codes in particular files. after you configure the openCV in your project properties it will work file without any errors.

just makesure openCV configuartion and correct PATH is set according to your operating system.
